When we need to perform an operation, there are multiple ways to do, and a particular way is selected to perform the operation.

Classifications of Computer Architecture

In Von Neuman Architecture, both the data and instructions are stored in the same memory and travel through the same path. So, the processor cannot simultaneously read instruction and operate on data. This is known as Von-Neuman Bottleneck.

Coming to the Harvard Architecture, two different memory are present for instruction and data. So, the computer under this category will be faster. In Modified harvard Architecture, a cache memory will be present and this is used in modern computers.

Von-Neuman architecture comes under SISD. Here, Control->CPU
